    "\n",
    "You might recognize our team name, \"Sky Team,\" as being very similar to one of the world's leading airline alliances, SkyTeam. This isn't unintentional. We felt this was a great name for our project, as our mutual love of aviation and interest in exploring the massive amount of data that was collected by San Francisco Airport Commission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About that data...\n",
    "\n",
    "It's located [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-traffic-passenger-statistics), and it's from San Francisco International Airport. The City of San Francisco, through its SFO Airport Commission, is responsible for the data we used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the point?\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have here is an aviation enthusiast (or data scientist's) dream. We have over 17,500 rows of data, spanning over 12 years! In SFO alone, the airline industry has changed so much over that period of time that there will be plenty of observable trends derived from the metrics gleaned by SFOAC in this databank. There's even many airlines on that list who (sadly) no longer grace our skies...the consolidation of the airline industry from 2009-2015 has really left its mark."
